      <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm Jared Leahy, and I'm an aspiring web-developer/software designer. I love reading, watching tv, and playing games. I also love coding, particularly front-end. I've been in Computer Science classes for a long time and have really enjoyed all of them, especially the mathematical, algorithmic nature of coding, and the interactive elements of design.</p>
