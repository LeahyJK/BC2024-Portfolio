      <ul class="skill-list">
        <li>Timeliness. I always try my best to be punctual, and very rarely end up late unless due to a simply poor decision, something out of my control, or a combination of both.</li>
          <li>Communication. I have no trouble with working in groups, or with reporting to persons in charge.</li>
          <li>Reading. I have been told that I am a strong and fast reader, and have found myself comfortable with reading and researching technical documents over computer science topics, such as syntax, errors, and structures.</li>
          <li>Collaboration. I work well with groups I am comfortable in, but I have had to learn about my shortcomings when it comes to working with unfamiliar people.</li>
          <li>Leadership/Responsibility. I would rather not take on either of these, but I can, and I have been told by past teammates that I'm not incapable of it, but I do need more practice in this skill for the sake of development.</li>

      <ul class="skill-list"><h2>List of Coding Languages I've used.</h2>
        <li>Python.</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
        <li>C#/Java.</li>
        <li>Lua/Basic.</li>
        <li>Object Oriented Programming.</li>

      <p>I would consider myself at least practiced in all of the listed coding languages, and have made or worked on
        projects using each of them multiple times. Ultimately though, I am most proficient in Python and Web code(HTML, etc.). 
        The other languagesI either haven't had as much practice with, or I haven't used them in a while.
      </p>
      <p> I do understand that OOP isn't a language, but I included it in the list because it is a framework that exists
        as a way to think about how you write code, and I consider that at least similar in concept, considering how different coding languages are only differed by the syntax.
