          <p>I would consider myself at least practiced in all of the listed coding languages, and have made or worked on
            projects using each of them multiple times. Ultimately though, I am most proficient in Python and Web code(HTML, etc.). 
            The other languagesI either haven't had as much practice with, or I haven't used them in a while.
          </p>
          <p> I do understand that OOP isn't a language, but I included it in the list because it is a framework that exists
            as a way to think about how you write code, and I consider that at least similar in concept, considering how different coding languages are only differed by the syntax.
